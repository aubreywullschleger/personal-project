# Project Proposal

My app will track a users mood over time based on journaling (key words) and have exercises for self-reflection/awareness to help users realize the state of their mental health.

I will use Dandelion API to discern word sentiment and use known CBT exercises for self-reflection. Resources will be available to users who are seeking extra help.

Users will login, record their mood for the day (with a journal entry) the mood data will be recorded on a graph that the user can choose to view (or not), and be given a self-reflection exercise for the day based on the entry.


Stretch goals:
- connect to a health tracking API (waiting for key) to show what effect physical activities, food, stresses have on a users mood.

- make the app able social -- if users are having mental health issues or if they have had issues, share their stories to help others/know that they are not alone with said issues.
